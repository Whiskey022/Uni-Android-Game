Very basic Java Android game application created for a university assignment.

It is a 2D racing game, where the user tries to collect as many coins without crashing into AI cars. Game scores are stored in an external MySQL database server.

To run the application you can simply upload "bin/app.apk" file to your phone and install it. Backend REST API server is no longer active though, so submitting/viewing scores is not going to work.
